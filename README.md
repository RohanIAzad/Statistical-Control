**Description of the problem**

Previously, students accessed the materials for a particular course through a third-party learning platform, which incurred costs for the company every time a student logged in. 
To mitigate these costs, the company developed an in-house learning paltform called ***ODYSSEY*** where students can now access their materials directly.

An A/B test was conducted to compare the performance of the old system with the new in-house platform. 
The test group consisted of 279 students from a specific section of an instructor. 
The goal was to identify a comparable group of studnets from the remaining sections of the same instructor.

Since the test group was predetermined, statistical control was implemented to determine the effectiveness of ***ODYSSEY*** instead of finding a separate comparable control group.
